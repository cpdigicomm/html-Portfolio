   <h1>Top Spy Thriller Movies Of All time!</h1>

   <h2>As a fan of spy thrillers here my list of the top 3 Spy thrillers I enjoy and a mini<br />
        story of what there about</h2>
   
   <hr />
   
   <h3>The Sum Of All Fears</h3><img src="../assets/images/sum.png"/>
   
   <p>CIA analyst Jack Ryan must stop the plans of a Neo-Nazi faction<br />
       that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States<br />
        and Russia's President by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game<br />
        in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
        
        <p>When the President of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose<br />
        politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. This change in political leaders sparks<br />
        paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA Director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) <br />
        recruits young analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) to supply insight and advice<br />
        on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a US city,<br />
        and America is quick to blame the Russians.</p>
   
   
        <h3>The Good Shepard</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/shepard.png"/>
        <p>The tumultuous early history of the Central Intelligence Agency is viewed<br />
           through the prism of one man's life.</p>
   
            <p>Laconic and self-contained, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) heads C.I.A. covert operations<br />
               during the Bay of Pigs. The agency suspects that Fidel Castro was tipped, so Wilson looks for the leak.<br />
               As he investigates, he recalls, in a series of flashbacks, his father's death, student days<br />
               at Yale (poetry; Skull and Bones), recruitment into the fledgling O.S.S., truncated affairs, a<br />
               shotgun marriage, cutting his teeth on spy craft in London, distance from his son, the emergence of<br />
               the Cold War, and relationships with agency, British, and Soviet counterparts. We watch his<br />
               idealism give way to something else: disclosing the nature of that something else is at the heart of<br />
               this movie's narration as he closes in on the leak.</p>
   
   
   
               <h3>Tinker Tailor Soldier</h3>
               <img src="../assets/images/tinker.png" ./>
               <p>In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement<br />
                  to uncover a Soviet Agent within MI6.</p>
   
                  <p>In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control (Sir John Hurt),<br />
                   resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed<br />
                   one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian Agent, a mole, and the Hungary operation<br />
                   was an attempt to identify which one it was. George Smiley (Gary Oldman) had been forced into retirement<br />
                   by Control's departure, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by<br />
                   rogue Agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the<br />
                   Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet<br />
                   Intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.</p>
