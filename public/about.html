  <h1>About Me</h1>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12717265/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"> <img src="../assets/images/imdb.png"   alt="Picture of James Uccello IMDB" height=100 ./> </a>
<p>
  My life has been full of great challenges and rewardss. I am a proud father with 2 wonderfull acomplished kids. I'm a Journeyman Wireman Electrician state licensed in CA, UT, ID, CT, ME, NH, MA, OR, WA. I am not only a High School Graduate, but have Graduated from the IBEW 5 year Apprenticeship program. I went on to obtain my Class A license to help open the doors into the Motion Picture Indsutry as a Teamster/Electrician Production Van Operator.
  </p>

<p>During my time as a IBEW Electrician, Ive  gotten the opptunity to not only travel, make new friends which some became close as family, but to also be part of a team and help build some great projects such as:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Facebook MPK22 Facility</h3>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Apple Infinite Campus</h3>
      <img src="../assets/images/AppleInfinite.png" alt="Collages of Apple infinite campus" height="130">
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Google Campus</h3>
      <img src="../assets/images/google.png" alt="Collages of Google Campus" height="130">
    </li>
  </ul>
 </p>

 <p>The time I spent on the road building these projects has allowed me to grow personally by learning strong work skills needed to function as a team member instead of as a individual. I learned many skills along the way that have taken me from a fresh apprentice level Wireman all the way up to a Journeyman Wiremen in a leadership role.</p>

 <p>The hardest thing about being on the road wasnt actually being on the road, but the hurt I felt each day being away from my kids, the sadness grew each night as I laid my head to sleep to the point I had to find a different avenue in order to spend more time with them before my eyes blinked and when they open again I would be seeing them as adults missing the journey along the way.</p>
 
<p>I reached out to colleagues and in my home area to discussed my situatuation. Turns out because I was a license electrician this opened a door to work as only a Generator Operator for the Studio's</p>

<p>Over time I met more amazing people while working on numerous projects being part of the team who put me on the path to becoming a Motion Picture Teamster. I obtained my Class A license, struggled to work as a permit to fullfill the days needed to join this amazing industry. At the end of the journey I was now allowed to work in the Motion Picture industry a "Production Van Operator" which is a Teamster who drives and operates Generators withing the Motion Picture world.</p>

<p>The joy I feel today inside I cannot explain, the happiness I can only hope will shine through my face to show everyone how excited I am to be able to be with my kids each and every day now. Sharing our life journeys together as we progress through time as a whole instead of 3 individuals collaborating now and then on 3 seperate projects.</p>

<p>Unfortunatley times change and the Motion Picture industry has slowed down forcing me to pivet once more in order to keep this new journey heading in the direction I have fought so hard to steer towards.</p>

<p>Inspired by my kids to try new things even when these new things might be a little scary, I sit before this computer screen learning a skill and taking on a new challenge of become a Full Stack Developer. I cant wait to see what the future holds and how all these trials and tribulations will intertwine with each other. I can say this, If you want to know me and the person I am, just look back at this page and think to yourself, is this a person who has the ability to learn, adjust and move forward when times times get tough or will he fold because he is older and new at this coding thing? You bet your ass I will Succeed! I will fight through the challenges, continue to learn, adapt and move forward to the new goal that is now set in order to achieve 1 purpose "The stability of my families future!"</p>
